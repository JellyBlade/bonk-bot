# bonk-bot
The only discord bot that plays VIP Aersia Playlists (I think, anyways).

It was an interesting experiment in making a discord bot, and a bit unique in my opinion.

Most discord music bots simply request youtube links from users, then play those.
Bonk Bot maintains a list of [.xspf files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Shareable_Playlist_Format) that contains play information for the various [Aersia playlists](https://aersia.net/).
The bot parses these lists when asked by a user, and randomly shuffle-plays the entire list randomly forever, like a radio. This is similar to how the [playlist itself functions](https://www.vipvgm.net/).

As far as I know, this is the only publicly-available discord bot in the world to do this, which is pretty neat.
